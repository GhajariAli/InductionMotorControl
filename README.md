I've Designed the control boad around this IC fro Infineon [IGCM04F60GAXKMA1](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/IGCM04F60GAXKMA1/5960098)

Here is the video of testing the circuit and getting initial result:

So I designed a PCB to get things going Faster, you can find the KiCAD design and initial code to run the motor in [THIS](https://github.com/GhajariAli/InductionMotorControl/tree/FirstCurcuitDesign)https://github.com/GhajariAli/InductionMotorControl/tree/FirstCurcuitDesign branch
